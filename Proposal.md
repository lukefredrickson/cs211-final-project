# CS 211 Final Project Proposal
### Luke Fredrickson
#### November 30, 2020

I'll be doing this project individually. My dataset will be the [Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e) dataset from https://data.cityofnewyork.us. I'm going to try to answer clearly important questions about the data, with differential privacy, such as average/median pay per department, longest employed employees per department, etc.
